# **DevOps Portfolio**

Welcome to my **DevOps Portfolio**! This repository showcases my skills and experience as a **DevOps engineer**. It contains various projects and resources that demonstrate my capabilities in automating, managing, and deploying infrastructure and applications using a variety of tools and technologies.

## **About Me**

I am a passionate and skilled **Software Engineer** with experience in automating infrastructure, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), cloud computing, and containerization. With a background in software engineering, I have honed my ability to work with various technologies that enable the efficient development, deployment, and maintenance of applications.

I thrive in fast-paced environments and am continuously learning and adapting to the latest technologies and best practices in **DevOps**.

## **Skills**

Here are some of the key skills I bring to the table as a **DevOps engineer**:

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Terraform**
- **AWS CloudFormation**
- **Ansible**

### **Cloud Platforms**
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, VPC, IAM, and more.
- **Microsoft Azure**

### **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- **Jenkins**
- **GitLab CI**

### **Containerization and Orchestration**
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Docker Compose**

### **Configuration Management**
- **Ansible**
- **Chef**

### **Scripting and Automation**
- **Bash**
- **Python**
- **Shell Scripting**

### **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Prometheus**
- **Grafana**
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### **Version Control Systems**
- **Git** (GitHub, GitLab)

## **Projects**

### **Project 1: Shell Scripting for User Management and Backup**

**Description**: In this project, I created a set of shell scripts to manage user accounts and backups. The scripts automate user creation, deletion, and modification, as well as backup and restore operations for system directories and files. This project highlights my proficiency in **shell scripting** and **system administration** tasks.

For more details, check out the **`project-1-shell-scripting`** folder in this repository.

## Project 2: Two-Tier Flask App

In this project, I developed a Two-Tier Flask application. The app consists of two main components: a Flask backend API and a simple frontend. The backend handles requests and serves data, while the frontend interacts with the backend to display information. This project demonstrates my ability to build web applications using Flask and to work with two-tier architectures.

For more details, check out the [project-2-two-tier-flask-app](./project-2-two-tier-flask-app) folder in this repository.

### Project 3: DevSecOps Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application

In this project, I set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a **Node.js application** with a focus on **DevSecOps** practices. The pipeline includes stages for:
- **Code quality analysis** using **SonarQube**.
- **Security testing** using **OWASP tools**.
- **Docker image vulnerability scanning** with **Trivy**.
- **Automated deployment** with Jenkins.

This project demonstrates how to integrate security, code quality, and continuous integration/continuous deployment into the software development lifecycle, ensuring robust and secure application development practices.

For more details, check out the `project-3-devsecops-pipeline` folder in this repository.

## Project 4: Deployment of a Three-Tier Application on AWS EKS

In this project, I deployed a scalable three-tier application consisting of a **ReactJS front-end**, **NodeJS back-end**, and a **MongoDB database** on **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**. The project utilizes **Kubernetes** for container orchestration, **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** for traffic distribution, and **MongoDB** as the database tier. This deployment demonstrates the ability to build and manage cloud-native applications, providing hands-on experience in deploying highly available and scalable applications using Kubernetes on AWS.

For more details, check out the `project-4-aws-eks-three-tier-app` folder in this repository.
