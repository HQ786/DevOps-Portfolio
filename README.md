## **Projects**

### **Project 1: Shell Scripting for User Management and Backup**

**Description**: In this project, I created a set of shell scripts to manage user accounts and backups. The scripts automate user creation, deletion, and modification, as well as backup and restore operations for system directories and files. This project highlights my proficiency in **shell scripting** and **system administration** tasks.

For more details, check out the **`project-1-shell-scripting`** folder in this repository.

## Project 2: Two-Tier Flask App

In this project, I developed a Two-Tier Flask application. The app consists of two main components: a Flask backend API and a simple frontend. The backend handles requests and serves data, while the frontend interacts with the backend to display information. This project demonstrates my ability to build web applications using Flask and to work with two-tier architectures.

For more details, check out the [project-2-two-tier-flask-app](./project-2-two-tier-flask-app) folder in this repository.

### Project 3: DevSecOps Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application

In this project, I set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a **Node.js application** with a focus on **DevSecOps** practices. The pipeline includes stages for:
- **Code quality analysis** using **SonarQube**.
- **Security testing** using **OWASP tools**.
- **Docker image vulnerability scanning** with **Trivy**.
- **Automated deployment** with Jenkins.

This project demonstrates how to integrate security, code quality, and continuous integration/continuous deployment into the software development lifecycle, ensuring robust and secure application development practices.

For more details, check out the `project-3-devsecops-pipeline` folder in this repository.

## Project 4: Deployment of a Three-Tier Application on AWS EKS

In this project, I deployed a scalable three-tier application consisting of a **ReactJS front-end**, **NodeJS back-end**, and a **MongoDB database** on **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**. The project utilizes **Kubernetes** for container orchestration, **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** for traffic distribution, and **MongoDB** as the database tier. This deployment demonstrates the ability to build and manage cloud-native applications, providing hands-on experience in deploying highly available and scalable applications using Kubernetes on AWS.

For more details, check out the `project-4-aws-eks-three-tier-app` folder in this repository.

### Project 5: Creation of a Production-Ready Infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible

In this project, I focused on creating a **scalable, production-ready infrastructure** on **AWS** using **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning and **Ansible** for configuration management. The project involved setting up a **multi-tier architecture** with different components such as **EC2 instances**, **RDS databases**, and **S3 storage**. 

The key tasks included:
- Using **Terraform** to provision and manage the infrastructure components on AWS.
- Setting up **remote backends** for Terraform state management to ensure reliable and consistent deployments.
- Automating the configuration of the infrastructure with **Ansible**, ensuring the environment is ready for application deployment.
- Implementing a multi-tier architecture (web, application, and database tiers) to ensure scalability and high availability.

This project highlights my ability to work with **cloud infrastructure**, **infrastructure as code**, and **configuration management tools**, demonstrating practical skills needed to deploy robust and scalable applications in production environments.

For more details, check out the `project-5-terraform-ansible-aws-infrastructure` folder in this repository.


## Project 6: Monitoring and Visualization for a Kubernetes-Based Application on Grafana with Metrics on Prometheus

### Overview/Description
This project involves setting up a robust monitoring solution for a Kubernetes-based application using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

- **Prometheus**: Used for collecting metrics and monitoring the health of the Kubernetes cluster and its resources.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes the metrics collected by Prometheus through interactive dashboards.
- **cAdvisor**: Enhances monitoring by providing detailed container metrics.

This project will give you hands-on experience in configuring monitoring and visualization for Kubernetes-based applications, ensuring the performance and reliability of your application.

### Tools Required
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Grafana**: For analytics and interactive visualization.
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration.
- **cAdvisor**: For container resource usage and performance analysis.

### For more details, check out the `project-6-monitoring-visualization-grafana-prometheus` folder in this repository.


## Project 7: Serverless Deployment of a ToDo Application

### Overview/Description
This project involves developing a ToDo application using a serverless architecture. The backend is powered by AWS Lambda, the API layer is exposed using AWS API Gateway, and AWS RDS is used for storing application data. The Serverless Framework simplifies deployment and management.

### Tools Required
- AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, NodeJS, AWS RDS, Serverless Framework.

### For more details, check out the `project-7-serverless-deployment-todo-app` folder in this repository.

## Project 8: Jenkins Integration with Kubernetes for CI/CD Pipeline
In this project, I demonstrated how to integrate Jenkins with Kubernetes to build an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters. The project involved setting up Jenkins, creating a Jenkins pipeline, integrating Kubernetes for dynamic scaling, and using Helm to manage Kubernetes deployments.
