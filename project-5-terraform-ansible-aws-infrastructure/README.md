## Project 5: Creation of a Production-Ready Infrastructure using Terraform and Configuration Management using Ansible

### Overview
This project focuses on building a scalable, production-ready infrastructure on AWS using **Terraform** for infrastructure as code and **Ansible** for configuration management and application deployment. The goal is to provision AWS resources such as **EC2 instances**, **RDS databases**, and **S3 buckets**, and manage them efficiently. This project demonstrates how to set up remote backends for state management in Terraform and implement a **multi-tier application architecture** to ensure high availability and scalability.

### Tools Used
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for provisioning AWS infrastructure components (EC2, RDS, S3, etc.).
- **Ansible**: Configuration management for automating application deployment and infrastructure configuration.
- **AWS**: Cloud infrastructure including EC2, RDS, S3, and more.
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code or any similar editor for managing the code.

### Functional Requirements
- **Terraform** to provision infrastructure components like EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets.
- Set up **remote backends** in Terraform for state management.
- Use **Ansible** for automating configuration management and application deployment.
- Implement a **multi-tier architecture**, including web, application, and database tiers.
- Ensure **high availability** and **scalability** of the infrastructure.
