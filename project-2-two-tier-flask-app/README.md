# Project 2: Containerization of a Two-Tier Application using Docker, Docker Compose, and Image Scanning with Docker Scout

## Project Overview

This project involves the containerization of a two-tier application, such as a web application with a database backend, using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. Additionally, Docker **Scout** will be used to scan the created Docker images for security vulnerabilities. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in **containerization**, **orchestration**, and **security scanning** for Dockerized applications.

## Tools Required

- **Docker**: For creating and managing containers. You can install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You can install Docker Compose from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **Docker Scout**: For scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities. You can install Docker Scout via Docker CLI using the command: `docker install scout`.
- **Code Editor**: Any code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or any editor of your choice.
- **Source Code of a Basic Two-Tier Application**: A simple web app with a backend database (e.g., a web app using Python Flask and MySQL, or Node.js with PostgreSQL).
